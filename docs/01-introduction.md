#### Project Overview

**CodyArchitect** is a VS Code extension designed to enhance the developer experience by integrating seamlessly with an existing extension. This extension aims to streamline the development workflow by providing custom commands and features. Specifically, CodyArchitect triggers a contribution point registered under the command `cody.mention.file` with a `vscode.Uri` parameter. By leveraging this command, CodyArchitect offers a more efficient and intuitive way to interact with files within the VS Code environment.
