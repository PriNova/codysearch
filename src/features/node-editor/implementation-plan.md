## Implementation Plan for Node-Editor Features:

### 1. Basic Webview Setup

* Create a new command to open the node editor webview
* Set up a basic React application within the webview
* Implement a simple "Hello World" render to ensure the webview is working

### 2. Frame Creation and Management

* Implement the ability to create new frames
* Allow users to set frame properties (path, filename)
* Display a list of created frames
* Enable frame deletion

### 3. Basic Node Creation and Editing

* Integrate React Flow for basic node rendering
* Implement node creation within frames
* Add text fields to nodes for natural language descriptions
* Allow basic node deletion and movement


### 4. Node Connections

* Implement input and output ports on nodes
* Enable users to create connections between nodes
* Validate connections to prevent invalid links


### 5. Code Generation Integration

* Add a "Generate Code" button to each node
* Integrate with the specified LLM API for code generation
* Display generated code within the node
* Store line ranges of generated code in node metadata

### 6. Code File Integration

* Create actual code files based on frame data
* Insert generated code into corresponding files
* Implement basic conflict resolution (e.g., append new code)

### 7. State Persistence

* Serialize node editor state to JSON
* Save state file in the workspace
* Implement loading of saved state

### 8. Advanced Code Integration

* Improve conflict resolution with side-by-side diff view
* Allow manual editing of generated code
* Update node metadata when code is manually edited


### 9. Drag-and-Drop Between Frames

* Implement drag-and-drop functionality for moving nodes between frames
* Update code files accordingly when nodes are moved

### 10. Performance Optimizations

* Implement virtualization for rendering large numbers of nodes
* Optimize React Flow rendering
* Add code-splitting and lazy-loading to the extension


### 11. User Interface Polish

* Improve overall UI/UX of the node editor
* Add helpful tooltips and documentation
* Implement user preferences for node editor behavior

For each step in this plan, we'll follow these principles:

1. Data-Oriented Design:

Define clear data structures for frames, nodes, connections, and editor state
Keep data separate from behavior
Use immutable data patterns where appropriate

2. Vertical Slice Architecture:

Implement each feature as a complete slice, from UI to data persistence
Organize code by feature rather than by technical layer

3. Iterative Development:

After each step, ensure we have a working, shippable product
Gather user feedback and adjust subsequent steps as needed

4. Testing:

Implement unit tests for core logic
Add integration tests for critical user flows
Conduct user acceptance testing after each major feature addition
